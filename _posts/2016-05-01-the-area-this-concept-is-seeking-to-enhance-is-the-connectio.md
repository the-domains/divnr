The area this concept is seeking to enhance is the connection between the consumer and the supply chain. We are expected to consume with a conscience. But, this is hard to do when the item we hold in the store is so isolated from its origins.

**Quick Explation of the Emotional Print **

An emotional print is formed of 9 colours, selected and arranged by a user from a limited palette to express their current emotional state. 

In response to a submitted state, the platform provides an identifier in the form of a QR Code that is valid for the individual for 24 hours, then they must resubmit their new emotional print. 

A designer of a product can use their QR Code on the day they created a new design. This then becomes the permanent identifier of the item and will see it throughout its lifetime.
